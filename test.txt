I like driving to my home city of New Orleans.
God, New York has so many famous tourist attractions, however I am not staying therefore I cannot go to any of them.
I would love to see the Empire State Building some time.
Did you know the Empire State Building was actually a gift from the French?
You didn't? Well, now you do.
Thanks for listening to my TED Talk.
